# DCS-MCT
DCS Mission & Commander Toolbox is a standalone tool to design, build and share an aviation based MilSim mission.  MCT attempts to skirt the fine line between the MilSim environment and it's real-world counterparts - great effort is made to use conventional terms, practices and approaches wherever possible while accommodating the many differences and limitations of the MilSim environments we use and the people we interact with.

<br />

# Beta Phase 1
MCT is currently in Beta phase 1 and is only available on an invite basis.  While final figures are yet to be determined, MCT will be licensed for around Â£30 GBP per year.  All testers will be granted a lifetime licence.

<br />

# Appeal
MCT is built by a single developer largely as a passion project and the decision to licence MCT was not taken lightly.  A small amount of funds made through licensing will cover the hosting and on-going upkeep / improvements to MCT.  The larger portion will be made directly available to AndCare UK; a new not-for-profit startup (by the developer of MCT) whose aim is to provide civilian reintegration training for experienced members of the Armed Forces using modern approaches to both mental health and digital / virtual technologies and environments.

# Tactical Operation (Work in Progress)
At the heart of MCT is the 'tactical operation' or TacOp - a way of representing the combined effort of multiple people to achieve a general main goal.  A TacOp contains a number of aspects to give each participant the information they need.

## Intel
When building a TacOp, you can add any amount of additional Intel separated into three categories; Threats, Friends and Resources.  An Intel entry can be a variety of different types such as A/V media (Photo's, Videos's etc.) or even pre-made kneeboards, DTC JSON config etc and are made available to all participants.

## Packages & Assets
A tactical operation will typically contain multiple ground and aerial assets of varying roles, such as JTAC's, E3 & AAR and may be a combination of human and / or AI controlled.  These assets are grouped into packages; with each package sharing a common objective.  Typically, a package would consist of one or more E3's, AAR tankers, strike and fighter assets, search and rescue etc.  MCT allows you to structure your packages how you see fit, such as grouping AI assets like AAR and E3 to their own package.

<br />

When adding an aerial package asset you can optionally specify a min and / or max quantity (between 1 and 4 inclusive) that this group must contain - for AI assets, this specifies the number of individual planes in the group.

# Profiles and Patching
MCT is primarily designed as a group tool with squadron level features.  When you use MCT, you will first need to create a profile, each profile you create may contain one or more 'patches' which can be seen as identities that belong to your profile.  When used as part of a squadron, your squadron administrator can provide you with an MCT squadron ID and associated information.  Adding this to your profile allows you to then download your squadron patch(es).

<br />

Regardless of squadron use, the MCT main page will show a public list of available TacOp's that have been made available with public patching.  With a squadron profile, you will also see private squadron only TacOps.
