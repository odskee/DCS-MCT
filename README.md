# DCS-MCT
MCT (Mission & Commander Toolbox) is a stand-alone tool to design, build and share an aviation based MilSim operation.  MCT attempts to skirt the fine line between the MilSim environment and it's real-world counterparts - great effort is made to use conventional terms, practices and approaches wherever possible while accommodating the many differences and limitations of the MilSim environments we use and the people we interact with.

<br />

It is a (currently Windows only) program installed locally on your system and is capable of operating as it's own experience.  Additionally, an online counterpart - MCT Online - enhances the functionality of MCT and provides additional multiplayer capabilities in the context of planning and building MilSim operations.

# Features

<br />
MCT has a continually growing list of features; some of which are still being developed but all are at some existing level of integration and / or development.  MCT itself is in a pre-release state and some features while present are still being 'polished'...

    <li>(In development) </li>
  </ul>
  <li>(In development) Real-Time Op building - collaboratively build Ops with other MCT users seeing changes applied in real-time</li>
  <li>(In development) Multi-Stage building - "Lock" certain parts of the Operation build, allowing other participants to contribute (i.e. Flight Leads)</li>
  
</ul>

# How to Join
MCT and MCT Online is currently in pre-release and open to willing testers.  To find out more and join the discussion on MCT, head over to the Discord at [https://discord.gg/Cv3rqHY2nK](https://discord.gg/Cv3rqHY2nK).

<br />

# Licensing
MCT is built by a single developer largely as a passion project and the decision to licence MCT was not taken lightly.  A small amount of funds made through licensing will cover the hosting and on-going upkeep and improvements to MCT and MCT Online.  The larger portion will be made directly available to AndCare UK; a not-for-profit startup (by the developer of MCT) whose goal is to provide accessible civilian reintegration training for members of NATO based Armed Forces using modern approaches to mental health and both real-world / virtual technologies and environments.

<br />
The final cost of MCT nor the mechanism of MCT Online integration is not yet decided but very likely to be around Â£40 GBP.  Currently, MCT is available to anyone eager & willing to test, see How to Join above.
